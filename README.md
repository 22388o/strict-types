# Rust implementation of strict encoding schema (STENS)

Strict encoding is a deterministic schema-base binary serialization format 
used for consensus protocols, networking, AluVM and long-term data storage. 
This library provides primitives for describing strict encoding schemata, 
validating and parsing structured data using the schema.

To learn more about strict encoding [read the spec](https://www.strict-encoding.org).
